Scraping is a mean of collecting data from various websites. This data then is often used for various analysis and sometimes the content is republished. There are tools like Selenium WebDriver, CasperJS which allow automated emulation of real user while interacting with browsers, with not much effort.</p>
<p>This post provides architectural overview and avoids code snippets. The Scraper explained in this post, went through multiple iterations. The goals changes forced the product to prove its mettle, adapt and transform. The product evolved as demand increased.<br></div><a href="/2015/09/19/scraping-alchemist-celery-selenium-phantomjs-and-tor/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2015/07/14/understanding-java-wrappers-and-collections-memory-usage/" class="post-title-link">Understanding Java Wrappers and Collections Memory Usage</a></h2><div class="post-info">Jul 14, 2015</div><div class="post-content"></div><a href="/2015/07/14/understanding-java-wrappers-and-collections-memory-usage/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2015/04/29/monster-centralized-monitoring-system/" class="post-title-link">Monster : A Centralized Monitoring System With OpenTSDB</a></h2><div class="post-info">Apr 29, 2015</div><div class="post-content"><p>Systems are rapidly becoming distributed in nature. Systems now a days are also implementing components which are designed to perform a specific task. With more and more components, they are spreading rapidly on different machines, different operating systems and they are altogether different in nature.  </p>
<p>In general, if something goes down or if something is not performing well, then one need to investigate the root cause of issue so as to tune system or to fix it. In complex systems, doing such analysis might become a complex task ending up consuming lots of resources. As there are multiple components involved, there would be multiple teams involved. This further slows down the investigation process. In worst case, business might get impacted because of poor performing system for such a long time. As a solution one can implement Central Monitoring System which collects critical metrics from each of the  collects. With this system in place, if something screws up, one can correlate all the events at a single location reducing the unnecessary overhead analyzing each component separately.<br></div><a href="/2015/04/29/monster-centralized-monitoring-system/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2015/03/07/issuefix-missing-artifact/" class="post-title-link">#IssueFix: Missing artifact jdk.tools:jdk.tools:jar:1.6 in Eclipse</a></h2><div class="post-info">Mar 7, 2015</div><div class="post-content"><p>Most of us face this issue when they are working with Hadoop related source codes.

HDFS spans across multiple machines on multiple racks. There are two types of nodes in HDFS:</p>
<ul>
<li>DataNode</li>
<li>NameNode</li>
</ul>
<p>The nodes responsible for storing files and handling IOs are DataNodes where as NameNode is responsible for keeping the fs image and upkeep of the HDFS. HDFS is robust, highly flexible, faster, fault&nbsp;tolerant,&nbsp;easier to maintain, easier to scale out and reliable. Various decisions made while designing HDFS are responsible for such features and it makes HDFS suitable for many usecases.&nbsp; Lets have a brief look at how HDFS is designed and how file is written internally.<br></div><a href="/2015/03/04/hdfs-how-file-is-written/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2015/02/22/javascript-equality-truthyness/" class="post-title-link">JavaScript: Equality !== Truthyness</a></h2><div class="post-info">Feb 22, 2015</div><div class="post-content"><p>JavaScript, as others languages, have branching statements. These branching statements decide the flow of execution when provided with few specific conditions[i.e. stimulus]. These conditions are Boolean in nature. Besides default Boolean variables and equality operators, each DataType in JS has a Boolean[Truthy/Falsy] associated with it. In addition to these, equality operator are also of two type, strict equality operator and Coersion based equality operator.

CasperJS is a navigation scripting and testing utility. It’s execution takes place in sequential manner, in which one navigation step executes after other. For small number of steps, this behavior of CasperJS is perfectly fine. But as number of steps increase, the amount of time consumed can become very huge. This problem can be solved by introducing parallelism in the execution of navigation steps.<br></div><a href="/2014/08/25/casperjs-and-navigation-parallelism/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li></ul></section><footer><div class="paginator"></div><div class="copyright"><p>© 2013 - 2016 <a href="http://codailama.com">Santosh Pingale</a>, powered by <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank">Hexo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pinggod/hexo-theme-apollo" target="_blank">apollo</a>.</p></div></footer></div><script async src="//cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.6.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];e.src='//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js';r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)}(window,document,'script','ga'));ga('create',"UA-6516328-4",'auto');ga('send','pageview');</script></body></html>
